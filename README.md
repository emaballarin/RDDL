# `RDDL`: *`R`apid `D`eployment `D`eep `L`earning*

A *Conda*-based, templatable, extendable, R&D-focused infrastructure scaffold aiming at fast iterability and *cross-unix* robustness.

---

Some relevant specifications:

- The *entire thing* is **Python-based**.
- **PyTorch** and **JAX** (plus some respective extensions) are the supported *deep learning* frameworks. Some inter-operability is also guaranteed.
- The *hardware stack* of reference is **Intel CPU** and **Nvidia GPU**.
- A **UNIX** (or *UNIX-like* at least) system is a prerequisite.
